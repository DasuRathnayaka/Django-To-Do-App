<p>Are you sure you want to delete "{{item}}"?</p>

<a href = "{% url 'list' %}"> Cancel</a>

<form method = "POST" action = "">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <input type = "submit" name ="Confirm">
</form>


<!--This looks like a confirmation prompt for deleting an item from a list. The HTML code includes a message asking the user to confirm whether they want to delete the item "{{item}}". The message is followed by a "Cancel" link that will take the user back to the list view without deleting the item.

If the user decides to proceed with the deletion, they can click the "Confirm" button, which will submit a POST request to the server. The server should handle this request and delete the item from the list before redirecting the user to the list view.

The {% csrf_token %} is a Django template tag that adds a hidden input field containing a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token to the form. This is a security measure that helps prevent malicious attacks on the site.
